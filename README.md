## KU Leuven Libraries on GitHub

Read [here](https://github.com/KU-Leuven-Libraries/Welcome-to-KU-Libraries-OpenGLAM/blob/master/README.md) a brief introduction of KU Leuven Libraries on GitHub.  

# The Portraits Collection

The portrait collection at [KU Libraries Special Collections](https://bib.kuleuven.be/bijzondere-collecties/english/home) contains approximately 10.000 prints created between the sixteenth and the twentieth century. They were executed in various techniques: etching, lithograph, mezzotint, steel engraving, wood engraving, heli engraving, etc. The portraits depict professors and academics from Leuven as well as kings, emperors and other aristocratic figures. In some cases they present other scholars and artists. Most portraits are loose leaf materials; others are preserved as part of portrait albums. The portraits were digitised and described as part of the [Europeana project](https://www.europeana.eu/portal/en). The digitisation project was completed in the spring of 2012.

  
 
    
# The Portraits Dataset

# Repository type  
The Portraits dataset is a repository of descriptive metadata representing all the single-file documents with graphic art from the Special Collections of the KU Leuven Libraries that depict people. The digitized Portraits Collection can also be explored through the [Libraries‚Äô Curated Collections](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81386064490001488&lang=en_US) discovery interface, within the thematic collection ‚Äú[Graphic works](https://limo.libis.be/primo-explore/collectionDiscovery?vid=KULeuven&collectionId=81411248760001488&lang=en_US&query=any,contains,portraits)‚Äù.  
  
# Who can use it  
The repository is designated as a free resource for digital humanities research, for scholars, students and teachers. It also is intended for creative reuses, data visualisations and algorithmic processing.  
  
# Provenance  
The dataset is fully based on the library catalogue metadata. It holds the descriptive metadata as well as URL links to the digital representation in thumbnail format. The dataset is published in two formats: an XML file that contains the unprocessed dataset as downloaded from the Alma digital preservation environment of the KU Leuven Libraries and a CSV file that contains computationally more amenable curated data. The data was cleaned, transformed and refined with the OpenRefine application software, resulting into 760 individual data processing task. The ensuing file of the OpenRefine can also be found in the repository.

  

# Technical Description

The CSV file contains 10.511 records in rows and 23 columns with the following metadata:



# Cite this dataset

When referring to or using the data repository in research publications and documentation, consider citing the dataset with its digital object identifier (DOI) that is minted in Zenodo.

It also reduces the amount of "orphaned data," helping to retain source links.
